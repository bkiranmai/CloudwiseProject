# CloudwiseProject

Hi team,
 
I had successfully completed the cloudwise assignment  which consists of two parts.

Part -1:
There are 3 feature files in which I had covered all the scenarios related to the assignment using Selenium, Cucumber and Java.
1. Finding duplicate names
2. Broken links
3. Verify title

Here, I deliberately used Thread.sleep() instead of WebDriver wait  so that one can get clear understanding and flow of execution  while running the test scripts.


Part-2:
I had completed the Gatekeeper assignment which consists of 4 challenges in a Linear way.

You can find them in same project  src/test/java under gatekeeperChallenge package.
